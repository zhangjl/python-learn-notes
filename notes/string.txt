1. 字符串操作
    连接：str1 + str2
    获取字串: str[index1:index2]
    s = "abcde";s[:None] # abcde

A prefix of 'b' or 'B' is ignored in Python 2; it indicates that the literal
should become a bytes literal in Python 3 (e.g. when code is automatically
converted with 2to3). A 'u' or 'b' prefix may be followed by an 'r' prefix.

Bytes literals are always prefixed with 'b' or 'B'; they produce an instance
of the bytes type instead of the str type. They may only contain ASCII
characters; bytes with a numeric value of 128 or greater must be expressed
with escapes.
